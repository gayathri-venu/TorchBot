# Presenting TorchBot (dramatic enough :D)

So this is basically a Chatbot based on Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus dataset built using PyTorch.

### Steps involved

1. Handle loading and preprocessing of Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus dataset

2. Implement a sequence-to-sequence model with Luong attention mechanism(s)

3. Jointly train encoder and decoder models using mini-batches

4. Implement greedy-search decoding module

5. Interact with trained chatbot
